There are two main methods for metric extraction. The ROI\nextraction makes a 2D representation from the 3D image for simplified\nextraction. VOI extraction takes advantage of full 3D DaTSCAN image and\nstructural images (MRI).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Manual ROI extraction</strong> The ROI is manually deliniated by an\nexpert</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Template ROI extraction</strong></p>\n<p>(a)  The first involves placing preconstructed-trapezoidal ROIs over the striatal compartment of the 2D image.</p>\n<p>(b)  The second involves taking the DaTSCAN image and nomalizing it to a space where pre constructed ROI are known and can be placed over the modified image.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>VOI MRI extraction</strong> This method involves the use of complimentary\nstructural imaging to determine the volume of interest in the\nDaTSCAN. The VOIs are segmented out of structural images such as MRI\nmanually through segmentation software (ITK-snap). Then the DaTSCAN\nand MRI are coregistered using rigid body transformation into the\nsame space.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"title":"Preliminaries and Related Work"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d0124eda-f0d7-5f43-b106-ed6e6d234212","frontmatter__slug":"/preliminaries","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"preliminaries"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["429448491"],"slicesMap":{}}
