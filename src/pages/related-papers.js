  `AI4PD rests on a retrospective, hypothesis-generating evidence base, not on prospective clinical proof. Every result below comes from existing PD research cohorts (PPMI, BioFIND, PDBP, FoxInsight, the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium) analyzed after the fact. These studies establish biomarker validity, cross-modal associations, and reproducible motor-phenotype structure. They do not establish temporal precedence, transportability, or per-patient clinical utility, and none is a diagnostic tool. Two of the lead manuscripts are still in preparation and therefore not public; their figures are marked pending and are not shown here.`,
  `One caveat belongs at the top because it shapes the headline numbers. The motor-state results use a full aligned PPMI table of 4,773 participant identifiers that is not restricted to confirmed PD; stricter PD-only cohorts (1,123–1,923 patients) show lower stability and far higher transition rates, and no single primary cohort was prespecified. Read the rest of this page with that denominator in mind.`,
  `This page lists, per study: cohorts, methods, effect sizes, limitations, and the source for each number. Where a finding is a candidate rather than a validated tool, it is labeled that way, in the authors' own wording.`,
  `The four works form one arc. We lead with the clinical motor-state results, then the genetic, molecular, and wearable signals that move a patient toward higher risk, then the imaging-circuit mechanism beneath that heterogeneity, and we close with the co-clustering method all three rest on. Co-clustering is foundational, placed last because it is the substrate, not the destination.`,

Severity is residualized out (domains regressed on total MDS-UPDRS-III, age, duration, sex, medication state, LEDD) to test for residual profile structure. Patient-held-out (GroupKFold) tree and boosting models predict next-visit transition, future axial burden, and the 5-D soft posterior from DaTSCAN SBR plus FreeSurfer ASEG features. BioFIND transfer reassigns states and tests endpoint gradients (Kruskal-Wallis eta²) with 1,000-replicate bootstrap CIs.`,

      intro: `A separate in-preparation manuscript by the same group reuses motor-phenotype machinery for a different question: finding rapid progressors for trial enrichment. These are two distinct manuscripts; the numbers do not transfer between them. The work above is PPMI-only, uses a 5-component Bayesian Gaussian mixture, and reports the stability, transition, imaging-recovery, and BioFIND face-validity figures. The companion below is a four-cohort study, uses HDBSCAN, and reports 70 phenotypes and a Silhouette of 0.9175. Do not carry numbers across.`,
      cohorts: `A deduplicated multi-cohort set of 62,543 unique patients and 221,437 motor assessments across four initiatives (PPMI, FoxInsight, PDBP, BioFIND), spanning 2010–2025. Per-cohort denominators are deliberately not stated here: the manuscript's two cohort tables disagree (for example PPMI 1,758 versus 4,786; BioFIND 124 versus 215), though both tables sum to 62,543. This BioFIND constituent is a different extraction from, and should not be confused with, the 344-visit / 225-patient BioFIND face-validity sample used by the motor-states work above. The longitudinal trajectory analysis is run on a 3,261-patient cohort with ≥3 visits.`,
      methods: `HDBSCAN (min_cluster_size=30, min_samples=15) selected via 5×5 nested cross-validation by Silhouette, with 1,000-resample bootstrap uncertainty and a LRRK2 G2019S burden analysis (Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d, bootstrap CI).`,
      findings: [
        `HDBSCAN discards roughly 77% of patients as noise by design (a high-confidence-core approach). The reported Silhouette of 0.9175 is computed on retained core points only and is far above the 0.35–0.55 typical of prior PD clustering, so it should not be read as out-of-sample separation. Bootstrap runs put the cluster count at 78–116, against a headline of 70; the manuscript reports this instability but does not fully reconcile it.`,
        `Within the 3,261-patient ≥3-visit trajectory cohort, three trajectories emerge: Improvers 19.0% (n=617), Stable 64.5% (n=2,102), and a Rapid Progressor subgroup of 16.6% (n=542; 542/3,261). The Rapid Progressor group worsens by +2.02 MDS-UPDRS-III points per ~6-month visit (about +4 points/year; higher score means more impairment). That annual figure assumes roughly 6-month, regularly spaced visits and linear progression, which the authors have not yet modeled with an irregular-time progression model. They call this a candidate trial-enrichment signal, not a validated biomarker.`,
        `The companion also reports the LRRK2 G2019S motor-burden effect (+4.35 points). This is the same LRRK2-consortium analysis that is the headline of the integrated-biomarkers preprint below, where it is reported in full; it is one analysis appearing in two manuscripts, not an independent replication.`,
      ],
      limitations: `The Rapid Progressor signal and all trial-efficiency projections are explicitly illustrative and require prospective and regulatory confirmation. The primary Silhouette (0.9175) sits well above the bootstrap mean (0.859), and a sex-difference table reports values likely contaminated by the data-entry anomalies its own QC flags.`,
