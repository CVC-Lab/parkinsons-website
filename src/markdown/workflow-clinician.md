# Workflow 2 — Clinician-Centered Decision & Visualization Pipeline

Workflow 2 operationalizes latent inferences for neurologists through interactive tooling. Outputs from Workflow 1 flow into ActionIntel dashboards, Free Motion visualization, and sensor-clinical correlation scores that support shared decision-making.

## Experience Design

- **Patient timelines:** Cross-visit overlays align gait, arm swing, and UPDRS-III subscores, exposing deviation from subtype baselines at a glance.
- **Motion exploration:** Animated gait and arm-swing reconstructions reveal asymmetries that standard in-clinic tests miss, with controls for patient selection, animation speed, and sensor segment inspection.
- **Cohort intelligence:** Sensor-clinical correlation dashboards highlight divergence events, while regulatory-ready documentation tracks provenance for audits.

## Deployment Pipeline

1. Ingest harmonized multimodal outputs from Workflow 1.
2. Validate dosage safety, contraindications, and sequencing within policy recommendations.
3. Stream personalized insights to clinician workstations and remote collaborators through secure UT Austin infrastructure.

## Impact

This workflow closes the loop from data harmonization to bedside impact. Neurologists gain interpretable, case-ready insight backed by latent modeling, while patients benefit from personalized, continually updated intervention plans.
